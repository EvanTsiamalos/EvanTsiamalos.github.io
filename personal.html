                    <p class = "p-info">I was born and raised in Larissa, Greece, where I attended the music high-school of Larissa. After that, I moved to Heraklion Greece for undergraduate studies at the <a href = "http://math.uoc.gr/el/" target = "_blank">Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, University of Crete </a>. I started studying as a graduate student in the Applied Mathematics graduate program with specialization in Statistics and Stochastic Analysis, but these studies were temporary, and I interrupted them in March 2022. I am now a trainee at the <a href = "https://www.cwi.nl/research/groups/machine-learning" target = "_blank">CWI Machine Learning Group </a> with <a href = "https://safestatistics.com/" target = "_blank">Professor Peter D. Grunwald</a> in Amsterdam, Netherlands</p>
                    <p class = "p-info">
                        I am skilled in theoretical analysis, mostly in measure theory, and probability theory. I am excited to apply this mathematical knowledge in topics of data science and use the computer science tools and procedures for problem solving. Also, I am interested in studying the mathematics behind computer science deeper.
            
                    </p>
                    <p class = "p-info">In the mean time, I continued my violin studies at the Heraklion Public Conservatory and I obtained my violin diploma in 2020. I was also part of the Larissa Youth Symphony Orchstra and  Heraklion Youth Symphony Orchestra.</p>
                    <p class = "p-info">I have become an administrative member of the Cretan Swing Shots dance team of University of Crete.</p>
