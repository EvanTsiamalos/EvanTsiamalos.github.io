                    <p class = "p-info">I was born and raised in Larissa, Greece, where I attended the music high-school of Larissa. After that, I moved to Heraklion Greece for undergraduate studies at the Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, University of Crete. I am now a graduate student in the Applied Mathematics graduate program with specialization in Statistics and Stochastic Analysis. </p>
                    <p class = "p-info">
                        I am skilled in theoretical analysis, mostly in measure theory, and probability theory. I am excited to apply this mathematical knowledge in topics of data science and use the computer science tools and procedures for problem solving. Also, I am interested in studying the mathematics behind computer science deeper.
            
                    </p>
                    <p class = "p-info">In the mean time, I continued my violin studies at the Heraklion Public Conservatory and I obtained my violin diploma in 2020. I was also part of the Larissa Youth Symphony Orchstra and  Heraklion Youth Symphony Orchestra.</p>
                    <p class = "p-info">I have become an administrative member of the Cretan Swing Shots dance team of University of Crete.</p>
